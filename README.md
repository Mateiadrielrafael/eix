# The eix-js engine:

This package was an older attempt at making a game engine. If you are trying to find a game enine to use, don't use this, it's not finished, and nobody is working on it. However, we started a new one, wch we are still working on. It's not ready to be used, but ir has a few nice features like an entity component system (with a query graph and all that cool stuff to make it more efficient), and even a server side package to use it with. If that seems cool to you, than check out [eix-js](https://github.com/eix-js/core/)!
